F4SE SAKE Distributor
======================


WIP plugin- and load-order independent patcher for Fallout 4's Races, Weapons, Armors, and (TBD) Actors. Allows distributing Spells, ActorValues, Keywords, and Enchantments via ini files. Also allows editing base weapon and armor instance stats.

- Could be used to make simple plugin-less mods and compatibility patches.
- Created for AmmoTweaks 2.0. It will be included in AmmoTweaks, and also released separately.
- ActorBase edits are not included yet.
- No documentation yet. A sample configuration template distributing additional damage resistances to different races and power armors is included in the bin folder.


Notes for compiling:

- The contents of the Plugin\src\SAKE folder need to be with the F4SE source files to compile ((Fallout 4 directory)\src\SAKE\)


Credits:

- Uses SimpleINI (https://github.com/brofield/simpleini) for config file read operations
- Created with Visual Studio 2017
